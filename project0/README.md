This website tries to explain how online slots can be profitable. There are 4 pages (4 html files in the main folder), with majority of information being on the index page. The other pages include a table of games, a list of games and unrelated cat photo. 

The css-file is in the assets/css folder. It simply changes the headline and background color based on screen size, adds some margins and makes sure the footer stays on the bottom of the page.

From the bootstrap I'm using the colums to split the index page into columns and the navigation header to make the site look slightly better.

SCSS has the bare minimum required, footer inheriting the font from the sub-title, while h2 is nested inside body tag.
