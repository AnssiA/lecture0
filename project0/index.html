    		<p>By default, when you play online slots, you lose money. Commonly the games have about 97% RTP (Return to player), so from $1 bet you are expected to get $0.97 back. Casinos, however, offer bonuses to players to attract them to play at their casino. In the past, these bonuses were very generous or weren't very well thought out, which allowed savvy players to make easy profit with them. For example, a old bonus might require you to deposit $100 to get $100 extra bonus money to play with. You could convert this bonus money by wagering the bonus amount 5 times ($500). Using simple math, we can see that the expected value of that offer is very high: $100 - ($500*(1-0.97))=$85. To meet this expected value as closely as possible, you want to play low-variance slots with small bet sizes. Unfortunately, offers like these aren't available any longer. Offers these days often require 35-50 times wagering requirements. $100 - ($3500*(1-0.97))=-$5. In addition to high wagering requirements, sites often forbid certain games. </p>
			<p>Fortunately, there is still a way to make profit with online slots. Unfortunately, this new strategy has very high variance. </p>
    		<ol>
    			<li>Find a deposit bonus that has high bonus portion (preferably at least 100%, but the higher, the better.)</li>
    			<li>Find a game with high variance </li>
    			<li>Make as large bets as the bonus offer allows</li>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Either you quickly lose everything</li>
    				<li>Or you occasionally hit it big and now have 6-100 times your initial bankroll. Now that you have multiplied your money, you can stop playing high-variance slot and "clear" the money using low-variance slot with small bet sizes.</li>
    			</ul>
    		</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-1"></div>
    		<div class="col-md-4">    		

    		<p>Let's look at a simple example:</p>
			<p>10 scenarios, $100 initial deposit, $100 bonus, 35x clearing requirements ($3500).</p>
			<p>    		9 times you lose everything =  -$100.</p>
    		1 time multiply your $200 to $1500. Now you need to clear the $3500.
    		$1500 -$3500*(1-0.97))=$1395.


    		<p>EV = (1395-900)/10 = $49.5. </p>

    		As can be seen, by taking advantage of the bonus money the sites give we can still make profit if we are willing to accept some risk. Even if the odds of success was 10%, that does not mean we will make profit every tenth offer we complete. It might very well take 32 offers until we finally make profit, or it might just one.
